The code in the repository allows for the user to add in all of his/her birdsightings. When this is done, the app automatically adds in the correct date for the sighting. The user is able to easily navigate through past birdsightings based on the date of sighting.

One thing that I learned during this tutorial is the ability to add in navigation buttons, and linking them to be able to add/cancel the adding of a bird. I also learned that sometimes xcode is a tool, and that errors can be gotten rid of by running the code after you've spent a half hour crying in a corner because you cant figure out why there is an error message in your code. 


Please and Blessings.
